  abstract  = {Standard semantic segmentation models owe their success to curated datasets with a fixed set of semantic categories, without contemplating 
  the possibility of identifying unknown objects from novel categories. Existing methods in outlier detection suffer from a lack of smoothness and 
  objectness in their predictions, due to limitations of the per-pixel classification paradigm. Furthermore, additional training for detecting outliers 
  harms the performance of known classes. In this paper, we explore another paradigm with region-level classification to better segment unknown objects. 
  We show that the object queries in mask classification tend to behave like one vs. all classifiers. Based on this finding, we propose a novel outlier 
  scoring function called RbA by defining the event of being an outlier as being rejected by all known classes. Our extensive experiments show that 
  mask classification improves the performance of the existing outlier detection methods, and the best results are achieved with the proposed RbA. We 
  also propose an objective to optimize RbA using minimal outlier supervision. Further fine-tuning with outliers improves the unknown performance, and 
  unlike previous methods, it does not degrade the inlier performance.}

  abstract={Addressing the Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation task is a prerequisite for perception systems
operating in an open-world environment. Large foundational models are frequently used in downstream tasks, however, their potential for OoD remains mostly unexplored. We seek to leverage a large
foundational model to achieve robust representation. Outlier supervision is a widely used strategy
for improving OoD detection of the existing segmentation networks. However, current approaches for
outlier supervision involve retraining parts of the original network, which is typically disruptive to the
model’s learned feature representation. Furthermore, retraining becomes infeasible in the case of large
foundational models. Our goal is to retrain for outlier segmentation without compromising the strong
representation space of the foundational model. To this end, we propose an adaptive, lightweight
unknown estimation module (UEM) for outlier supervision that significantly enhances the OoD segmentation performance without affecting the learned feature representation of the original network.
UEM learns a distribution for outliers and a generic distribution for known classes. Using the learned
distributions, we propose a likelihood-ratio-based outlier scoring function that fuses the confidence
of UEM with that of the pixel-wise segmentation inlier network to detect unknown objects. We also
propose an objective to optimize this score directly. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art
across multiple datasets, outperforming the previous best method by 5.74% average precision points
while having a lower false-positive rate. Importantly, strong inlier performance remains unaffected.}
