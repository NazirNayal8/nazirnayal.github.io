# In short: What is Competitive Programming ?

[Competitive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#:~:text=The%20aim%20of%20competitive%20programming,mathematical%20or%20logical%20in%20nature.)  is an activity that involves solving  computational problems by using different algorithms and data structures. These competitions are normally of fixed duration, which can vary from 2 hours, to several days. During a competitions, programmers (individual or in teams) compete against each other to solve the most number of problems in the fastest way possible.


<!-- # Rules

When a problem is solved, the contestants can receive either partial points if their solution partially solves the problem, like in the case of [IOI](https://ioinformatics.org/), or receive a full point only if their solutions solves the problem fully. I will elaborate on what it means to solve the problem fully or partially below.

This activity is the reason I found out about my interest in computer science.
