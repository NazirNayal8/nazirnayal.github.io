## About

The project is part of the project of the Distributed Systems and Reliable Networks Research Lab (DISNET) at Ko√ß University.

We implemented a simulator package that can be used offline or online to run a simulation over nodes locally or accross several machines. Our simulator
provides metric collection features, as well as modularity to implement and simulate any distributed system on top of it.
