## About

The project is part of the project of the Distributed Systems and Reliable Networks Research Lab (DISNET) at Ko√ß University.

[LightChain](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00375) is a DHT-Based Blockchain implemented over a
[Skip Graph](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1290672.1290674) overlay. It was designed by DISNET Lab members, and it provides several state of the art features.

Our task was to implement the Deterministic Finality algorithm used for resolving forks in the blockchain.
