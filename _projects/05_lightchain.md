## About

The project is part of the project of the Distributed Systems and Reliable Networks Research Lab (DISNET) at Ko√ß University.

[LightChain](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00375) is a DHT-Based Blockchain implemented over a
[Skip Graph](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1290672.1290674) overlay. It was designed but the DISNET Lab, and it has several state of the art features.

Our task was to implement a proof of concept for this design.

## Publication

You may find the details of our implementation and architecture in our demo paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9169463),
which was presented in [IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, 2020](https://icbc2020.ieee-icbc.org/).
