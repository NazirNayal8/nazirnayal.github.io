Recently, I have been becoming increasingly interested in how machines can perceive language and visual data. As a first step towards this research direction, I started working recently on examining ways to summarize high-level visual concepts into a few dense vector representations. This project is part of my Deep Learning with Computer Vision course I am taking this semester.

* Developing and Utilizing Deep Learning models in Computer Vision and in Natural Language Processing.
* Representation Learning for vision and language understanding problems.
