I am a Computer Science MSc Student at Koç University and a Fellow at the Koç University & İş Bankası Artificial Intelligence Center (KUIS AI). Working under the the supervision of [Asst. Prof. Fatma Güney](https://mysite.ku.edu.tr/fguney/). Interested in the applications of Deep Learning in Computer Vision and Representation Learning. Currently focusing on applications in Autonomous Driving.


I graduated with a BSc from Koç University Computer Engineering Department and was a recipient of [Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation for Education (AGFE)](https://www.alghurairfoundation.org/en) STEM Scholarship.



As a (nerdy) hobby, I am an active competitive programmer. I continuously participate in onsite, as well as online algorithmic competitions like the ones hosted on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) and [atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/home).

Aside from (nerdy, I guess) interests, I am very interested in fictional stories with coherent plots and thriller. My favorite writer is [Agatha Christie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie), and my favorite series is [Attack on Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan) by [Hajime Isayama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajime_Isayama).
