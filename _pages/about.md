I am a doctoral researcher at Computer Vision and Machine Learning Department (D2) at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbrücken, Germany, and a PhD student at Saarland University as part of the [CS@Max Planck](https://www.cis.mpg.de/) Doctoral Program.

I obtained my Computer Sciences and Engineering MSc degree from Koç University in Istanbul, Turkey, where I was a research fellow at the Koç University & İş Bankası Artificial Intelligence Center (KUIS AI), working under the supervision of [Fatma Güney](https://mysite.ku.edu.tr/fguney/) and [João F. Henriques](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~joao/) from VGG-Oxford.

I graduated with a BSc from Koç University Computer Engineering Department and was a recipient of [Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation for Education (AGFE)](https://www.alghurairfoundation.org/about-us/) STEM Scholarship.

## Research

My previous work was mainly on open-world segmentation and uncertainty estimation. Broadly interested in deep learning, computer vision, generative models, 3D Reconstruction, multi-modality, open-world learning, uncertainty.
