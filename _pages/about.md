I am a Computer Engineering Senior at Koç University and a recipient of
[Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation for Education (AGFE)](https://www.alghurairfoundation.org/en) STEM Scholarship.

I am also a member of Distributed Systems and Reliable Networks Laboratory (DISNET) at Koç University, where I am working on several
cool research projects.

<!-- My academic interests generally include software engineering design, algorithm & data structures, machine learning, and data science.

Aside from academia, I'm an active competitive programmer. I continuously participate in
online rounds hosted on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) and [atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/home). -->
