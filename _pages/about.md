I am a Computer Engineering Senior Student at Ko√ß University and a recipient of [Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation for Education (AGFE)](https://www.alghurairfoundation.org/en) STEM Scholarship.

I am currently in the process of applying for my graduate degree. My targeted research topics are:

* Developing and Utilizing Deep Learning models in Computer Vision and in Natural Language Processing.
* Representation Learning for vision and language understanding problems.

I am generally interested in several areas in computer science:
* Deep learning for Computer Vision and NLP
* Data Science and Statistics
* Algorithm & Data Structures
* Software Engineering Design

As a way to have more fun and challenges, I am an active competitive programmer. I continuously participate in onsite, as well as online algorithmic competitions like the ones hosted on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) and [atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/home).

Aside from technical and professional interests, I am very interested in fictional stories with coherent plots and thriller. My favorite writer is [Agatha Christie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie), and my favorite series is [Attack on Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan) by [Hajime Isayama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajime_Isayama).
