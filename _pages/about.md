I am a Computer Science MSc Student at Koç University and a Research Fellow at the Koç University & İş Bankası Artificial Intelligence Center (KUIS AI). Working under the the supervision of [Asst. Prof. Fatma Güney](https://mysite.ku.edu.tr/fguney/) and [João F. Henriques](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~joao/) on detecting rare events and unknown objects in autonomous driving scenarios. My project is funded by the [Newton Advanced Fellowship](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/newton-advanced-fellowships/). Interested Deep Learning, Open-World Learning, Out-of-Distribution Detection, Uncertainty Estimation, Robustness. Currently focusing on applications in Autonomous Driving.


I graduated with a BSc from Koç University Computer Engineering Department and was a recipient of [Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation for Education (AGFE)](https://www.alghurairfoundation.org/en) STEM Scholarship.
