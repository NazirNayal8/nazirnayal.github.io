## Location

The company is based in Vancouver, Canada, but I did the internship remotely.

## Duration

From August 2019 to December 2019

## About the Company

Dapper Labs is a blockchain design company. It is well-known for creating games on blockchain.
On of their famous applications was [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), which is a
game built on a blockchain.

## My Role

I was part of the networking layer team of the Flow Blockchain project. Our
task was to develop the network layer of the [Flow Blockchain](https://www.onflow.org/), which is
a smart contracts blockchain made to support the next generation of games, apps, and digital assets.

Throughout the internship period I worked with a team of other interns and experienced developers. We iterated over
several roles during the internship. These roles included small scale testing, large scale testing, research, Implementation,
and architecture development.


## Skills Learned

It was my first experience in a production level environment. We strictly maintained and followed the high-level coding practices.
These practices and coding styles were quite different from the way we normally code in research projects and university courses.

So I can summarize the skills learned as follows:

* Real case practice of agile development style.
* Unit and integrated testing.
* Production of high quality code with extensive documentation.
* Further understanding of network protocols, such as gRPC, TCP IP.
* Learned Object Oriented design with Golang.
* Improved my software design skills.
* Better understanding of smart contracts and blockchains.


## Challenges Faced

This internship was my first experience in which the code I write will be deployed to production. Therefore, much more focus and work was required
to make sure that the code base is robust and error-free. It took me time since the beginning of the internship to be able to produce good quality code. Especially considering that I was using Golang for the first time.
